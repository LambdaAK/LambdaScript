# LambdaScript

## An interpreted, functional programming language written using OCaml

<br>

Lambdascript is a statically-typed functional programming language designed to
make it easy to write elegant and expressive code. It has key features that
allow users to write clean and expressive code.

# Features

- Basic and compound data types: int, bool, str, unit, list, vector, et cetera

- Functional constructs: ternary expressions, anonymous functions, let
  expressions, currying, structural pattern matching

- Type inference algorithm: uses a type constraint generator and a unification
  algorithm to infer types

- A REPL allowing a user to type expressions and receive their value and type

- Rigorous OUnit test suite that utilizes functors, taking pre-built unit tests
  and outputting modified ones
